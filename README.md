# Initiative Roller

Hi! I'm Alexon, a brazilian developer passionate about TTRPG and this is my project, I hope it's useful to you in your games! :)

The thing about initiative rolls in TTRPGs is that you are always forced to use a static value or spend an eternity rolling dice every turn to determine who goes first, right? Well, not anymore!
There are very few steps to this process and I'll walk you through them below.

## Step 1: Add a new character to the list
This is the view you get right after opening the app:

<br>
So, first of all, we're gonna type a character's name in the input field  
<br>

<br>
Then, we're gonna press "Enter" to add it to the character list that just appeared!

## Step 2: Adding the modifiers
It's not uncommon for every character to have a unique value added to the result of a die roll, some systems make it more general while others enable more fine-tuning, but chances are: you are gonna deal with lots of different values added to different characters's rolls. To cover that, we're gonna add our characters's modifier values, by inputting a number directly or using the up/down arrow buttons that appear on the modifier input when it's focused.

## Step 3: Telling the app which type of die will be used in the roll
Different systems use different dice, and according to the system you're playing, click on the dropdown input and select the option fit for your game

## Step 4: Rolling!
Every time the Roll! button is clicked, it clears previous rolls and gives you new ones, adding the modifier values to the end roll of the chosen type of dice!
White Wolf systems organize turn order a bit differently from other systems, making characters declare their actions from the slowest to the quickest, in order to represent the quicker player's ability to act countering their slower enemies, so when D10 are chosen for the roll dice, the app gives you a "Declare action" ordered list, too!

#### And that's it! I [deployed](https://initiative-roller.vercel.app/) this experimental app using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and will keep updating it as I learn new ways to make it better!
